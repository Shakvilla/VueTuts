My study notes on Vue.js

"Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries." source: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html

# Data Binding in Vue Js

Binding an element to a data in vue is amazingly easy and simple as compared to Vanilla Javascript. In vue, we can easily render data to DOMM using template syntax element we declared. In the script folder, there file named Binding.html, open it and you will see an example of binding data to the DOM in Vue. We create a div tag with id "app":

  <div id="app">
      {{ helloworld}}
    </div>
